# Structural Factors of AI Hallucinations  
A structural and cognitive analysis of why large language models hallucinate.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This repository provides a conceptual and structural framework for understanding  
**why large language models (LLMs) generate hallucinations** — not as “bugs,”  
but as *probabilistic necessities* arising from model architecture,  
context dynamics, abstraction tension, and human–AI interaction styles.

The analysis explains how hallucinations emerge from:

- Abstraction overload  
- Context compression and reconstruction  
- Probabilistic inference mechanisms  
- Vector-space ambiguity  
- User-induced cognitive pressure  
- Absence of a world model and causal grounding

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### **1. Structural Drivers**
LLMs reconstruct language from compressed vector representations.  
During this reconstruction, **nearby concepts in latent space** may blend or  
interfere, producing outputs that are fluent but factually incorrect.

### **2. Cognitive Drivers**
LLMs optimize for the *most probable next token*, not for factual accuracy.  
This leads to:

- Confident but incorrect statements  
- Missing distinctions between similar concepts  
- Filling gaps with statistically plausible patterns  

### **3. Interaction Drivers**
Hallucination probability increases when users impose:

- High abstraction (“generalize,” “summarize at a meta-level”)  
- Multi-domain reasoning simultaneously  
- Long, dense conversational threads  
- Rapid contextual shifts  
- Ambiguous or underspecified prompts  

These conditions amplify inference spread and concept blending.

## 🧩 Why This Matters

Understanding hallucinations structurally — rather than emotionally or morally —  
enables more accurate evaluation of AI systems and more effective prompt strategies.

This project is intended to contribute to:

- AI reasoning research  
- Safety and interpretability discussions  
- Practical guidance for high-precision users  
- Education on LLM cognitive behaviors
